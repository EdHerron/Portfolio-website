                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Ed Herron and I am a budding new software developer. I started on my journey in 2022 to learn software development as I fancied a career switch and decided this was an interesting field with many opportunities.</p>
                    <p>I live just outside Belfast, Northern Ireland with my wife, Melissa. We have been married for less than a year and everything is going swimmingly so far! My interests include football (specifically Manchester United), gaming and hiking.</p>
                    <p>So far I have enjoyed dabbling in Javascript, HTML, CSS and Python, and I am looking forward to getting off the beaten track and studying some more obscure languages</p>
                    <p>The most enjoyable aspect of software development so far for me is the problem solving aspect. I have found this very engaging and I can't get enough of the feeling of satisfaction when your program finally runs as intended!</p>
                    <p>Please take a look at some of the projects I have put together and feel free to contact me with any interesting projects you may be working on!</p>
