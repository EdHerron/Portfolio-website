# A Portfolio Website for me (Ed Herron)
========================================

## Purpose of this website
----------------------------------------------

This website has been created as a way of hosting some projects I have created and would like to share with the world, specifically potential employers!

The HTML document contains the webpage that presents my information and projects as they are intended to be seen. However I have also included the CSS and Javascript documents so you can take a closer look under the bonnet.

I intend on creating a form in the future for you to tell me how you think I am doing and leave some suggestions.

Thank you for taking the time to havee a look!
